☀️ Predicting the sun's power for a sustainable future.

**  Overview**

This repository provides a framework for predicting solar irradiance, a crucial factor in optimizing renewable energy production.

**  Project Goals**

Develop a machine learning model for accurate solar irradiance prediction.
Compare the performance of different algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM).
Offer a clear and reproducible implementation for further research.
**  Dataset**

We utilize the HI-SEAS weather station Dataset dataset containing historical weather data and corresponding solar irradiance measurements.
